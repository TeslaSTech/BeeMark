# BeeMark

A Bee Movie based benchmark(?)

Yeah, I was bored.

Recommended commandline arguments are `-Xms8g -Xmx8G` so it can eat that sweet sweet DRAM.

Basically, it times how long both `Scanner` and `BufferedReader` take to read the entire Bee Movie script. 

A quick and easy benchmark for the family!

Not quite sure what it tests for yet tho on your machine.
